# Cleanup Documentation - Week 2 Thursday Analysis

## Files Removed/Cleaned Up

### 1. **Removed Bloat from Plots**

#### **Original Files (Removed):**
- `week2_thursday_improved_hypothesis_showcase.png` - Had cluttered text boxes overlaid on plots
- `week2_thursday_raw_vs_binned_comparison.png` - Had 6 subplots with excessive text boxes below

#### **New Clean Files (Created):**
- `week2_thursday_clean_hypothesis_showcase.png` - Clean 2-panel plot, no text boxes
- `week2_thursday_raw_data_models.png` - Simple 2-panel comparison (quadratic vs cubic only)

### 2. **Code Simplification**

#### **Removed from `improved_hypothesis_showcase.py`:**
- Complex text box positioning with `fig.add_gridspec(3, 2, height_ratios=[2, 2, 1])`
- Overly verbose statistical text boxes below plots
- 6-subplot comparison (reduced to 2)
- Linear model comparisons (kept only quadratic and cubic)
- Excessive annotations and text overlays

#### **Created `clean_hypothesis_showcase.py`:**
- Simple `plt.subplots(1, 2)` layout
- No text boxes - clean visualizations only
- Focused on key models: quadratic and cubic for raw data
- Streamlined code with essential functionality only

### 3. **What Was Preserved**

#### **Essential Elements Kept:**
- Salary binning analysis (core of the hypothesis)
- Cubic model fitting (R² = 0.963 for binned data)
- Jayden Daniels highlighting (supports the curve)
- Sweet spot identification ($15-20 range)
- Sample size annotations (n = #)
- Value ratio calculations

#### **Key Statistics Preserved:**
- Raw data: Quadratic R² = 0.375, Cubic R² = 0.432
- Binned data: Cubic R² = 0.963
- Optimal value range: $15-20 (0.655 pts/$)

### 4. **Rationale for Cleanup**

#### **Why Text Boxes Were Removed:**
- **Readability:** Text boxes made plots cluttered and hard to read
- **Focus:** Visual data should speak for itself
- **Documentation:** Statistical explanations belong in markdown, not on plots

#### **Why 6-Subplot Comparison Was Simplified:**
- **Clarity:** 2 focused comparisons are clearer than 6 busy subplots
- **Relevance:** Quadratic and cubic are the most relevant models
- **Message:** Raw vs binned comparison is the key insight

### 5. **Final Clean Output**

#### **Two Clean Plots:**
1. **Hypothesis Showcase:** Clean 2-panel plot showing binned data with cubic fit and value ratios
2. **Raw Data Models:** Simple comparison of quadratic vs cubic fits on raw individual player data

#### **Key Message Preserved:**
- **Parabolic relationship exists** (R² = 0.963 when binned)
- **$15-20 is the optimal range** (highest value ratio)
- **Individual player data masks the pattern** (raw R² = 0.432 vs binned R² = 0.963)
- **Jayden Daniels supports the curve** (not an outlier)

## Summary

The cleanup removed visual clutter while preserving all essential analytical insights. The plots now clearly communicate the hypothesis validation without overwhelming text, and the statistical explanations will be properly documented in the README markdown section.
