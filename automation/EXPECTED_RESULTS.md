# Expected Results for Automated Scrapers

## üìä Monday Workflow (Sunday Games) - Expected Results

Based on successful Week 6 manual scraper results:

### Expected Output:
- **File**: `weekX_Sunday_all_games.csv`
- **Raw scraped data**: ~700-800 players (with duplicates)
- **After deduplication**: ~400 unique players

### Position Breakdown (Expected):

- **RB**: ~90-95 players  
- **WR**: ~135-140 players
- **TE**: ~80-85 players

### Why Duplicates Occur:
- Same players appear in multiple game time slates
- Example: Patrick Mahomes appears in both:
  - "1:00 PM (10 NFL Games)"

- The comprehensive scraper captures ALL instances, then deduplication removes extras
